# Currency Coverter Project

The job was to build a simple currency converter app for one kind of coin to another one that allows users to quickly check the currency exchange rates.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Create a program that converts one kind of coin to another one
    - Display the conversion result on the screen

## Extra task

- I created a function that allows the user to enter the quantity they want to check directly on the page and immediately display the result.
